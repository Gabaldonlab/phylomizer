# Phylomizer

**Phylomizer** is an automated phylogenetics pipeline which aims to reproduce the three main step follow by traditional phylogeneticists. These steps, as shown in the image, are 1) Homology search, 2) Multiple Sequence Alignment Reconstruction, and 3) Phylogenetic Tree reconstruction.

**Phylomizer** can be used to reconstruct a single gene tree. However, it aims to assist on the reconstruction of large collection of phylogenies. In fact, **Phylomizer** has been used in [phylomedb.org](http://phylomedb.org) to generate more than 5.6 million phylogenetic trees, as January, 2016.
