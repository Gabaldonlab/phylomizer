PhylomeDB pipeline.

Here we present the PhylomeDB pipeline called "phylomizer" which has been used to generate more than 4 millions trees hosted at phylomedb.org.

This pipeline comprises the steps followed by traditional phylogeneticists: 1) Search of homologous sequences, 2) Reconstruction of multiple sequence alignment, and 3) Inference of phylogenetic trees.
